# Unity_Game-Asset-Management-System
I developed a Unity Asset Management System that combines Unity for game development, PHP for server-side operations, and MySQL for database management. The system allows users to log in, and their details, such as username and score, are securely updated in the MySQL database. C# is used within Unity to handle in-game operations and manage assets, while PHP serves as the backend to handle data transactions between the Unity application and the database. The user-friendly interface provides an easy way for players to interact with the system, track their progress, and manage their assets efficiently within the game environment.

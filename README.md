# Unity_Game-Asset-Management-System
I developed a Unity Asset Management System that combines Unity for game development, PHP for server-side operations, and MySQL for database management. The system allows users to log in, and their details, such as username and score, are securely updated in the MySQL database. C# is used within Unity to handle in-game operations.
